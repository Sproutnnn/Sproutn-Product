# Open Graph Image Setup

You need to create an image file named `og-image.png` in this directory.

## Requirements:
- **Dimensions**: 1200px × 630px (recommended for optimal display on all platforms)
- **Format**: PNG or JPG
- **Content**: The hero section with the globe, shipping routes, and tagline
- **File size**: Keep under 8MB (ideally under 1MB)

## How to create:
1. Take a screenshot of your hero section from the homepage
2. Crop/resize to 1200x630px using an image editor
3. Save as `og-image.png` in the `/public` folder
4. The HTML is already configured to use this image

## Current status:
The index.html already references `/og-image.png` in the Open Graph meta tags.
Once you add the image file, it will automatically be used for social sharing.
